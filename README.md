# keyboardnotfound.com

[keyboardnotfound.com](https://keyboardnotfound.com) is a joke website, that shows the famous "Keyboard not found, Press F1 to continue" message. However, on press of the F and 1 (or F1 or DEL) keys, confetti rains from the sky, and the message "YOU FOUND IT!" appears. 

This site serves literally no purpose other than wasting my $5/year and people's time.

Enjoy!
